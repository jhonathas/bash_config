My Bash Configuration
=====================

About
-----

This is my bash configuration inspired by [fnando] configuration (that is more complete than this one).

How to use
----------

Just clone this repository and load the init.sh file. I do it this way:

    $ git clone git://github.com/viniciussbs/bash_config.git ~/.bash.d
    $ echo "source ~/.bash.d/init.sh" > ~/bash_profile
